Thunder_for_OBData
==================

Thunderization of Olfactory bulb data



Things to modify before this can be run:

PYTHON
1. Colorize function in thunder - do not multiply by num samples
2. Colorize function in thunder - Commment lines that give polar map error.
2. Download pylibtiff for loading multitiff files
3. Download seaborn
4. Make sure spark is updated to new version and Pull request for numpy arrays is accounted for

MATLAB
1. Now loads 32 bit images. 
2. Use the image_register_multitiff.m for future use
